## üéØ Testing Strategies

### 1. Sequential Testing (Recommended)
Run requests in the following order for complete workflow testing:
1. System Health checks
2. Pre-Qualification ‚Üí Loan Application ‚Üí Application Processing ‚Üí Underwriting ‚Üí Credit Decision ‚Üí Quality Check ‚Üí Loan Funding
3. Third-party API validation

### 2. Individual Stage Testing
Test specific stages independently using the application number from previous stages.

### 3. Error Scenario Testing
Use the provided negative test cases to validate error handling:
- Invalid PAN numbers
- Low income scenarios
- Missing required fields
- Invalid data formats

### 4. Load Testing
Use the automated end-to-end test for repeated execution to test system performance.

## üîç Key Features

### Automated Test Scripts
- **Pre-request Scripts**: Generate unique test data (emails, phone numbers)
- **Test Scripts**: Validate responses and extract application numbers
- **Environment Variables**: Automatically store and reuse application data

### Comprehensive Data Models
- **Indian Market Specific**: PAN, Aadhaar, IFSC codes, Indian addresses
- **Real-world Scenarios**: Multiple loan types, employment types, income sources
- **Edge Cases**: Invalid data, boundary conditions, error scenarios

### Third-party Integration Testing
- **PAN Verification**: SurePass-style API simulation
- **CIBIL Integration**: Credit score and report generation
- **Bank Statement Analysis**: Account aggregator simulation
- **Employment Verification**: HR system integration
