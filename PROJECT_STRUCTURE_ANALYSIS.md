## 4. Database Schema Analysis

### 4.1 Current Schema Structure
```sql
-- Main Tables
applications          # Application registry
applicants           # Personal and loan data (JSON-based)
verifications        # Verification results
decisions           # Final loan decisions
stage_processing    # Stage tracking
audit_logs          # Audit trail
```

### 4.2 Schema Strengths

❌ **Missing Constraints**: Some foreign key constraints missing
❌ **Enum Value Mismatches**: Stage names don't match between tables
❌ **Query Optimization**: Some queries need optimization

### 4.4 Optimization Opportunities
1. **Index Optimization**: Add composite indexes for common query patterns
2. **Partitioning**: Consider table partitioning for large datasets
3. **Caching Strategy**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
